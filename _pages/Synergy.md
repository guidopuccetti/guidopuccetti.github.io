A molecular biologist armed with a profound understanding of bioinformatics possesses a significant advantage in today's scientific landscape. This unique combination of expertise allows researchers to conduct experiments with a comprehensive perspective, following the entire procedure from start to finish. The integration of molecular biology and bioinformatics provides a holistic understanding of experimental processes and greatly enhances the ability to interpret and analyze results effectively.

By having a firm grasp of bioinformatics, molecular biologists can navigate the vast amount of data generated from experiments. They are equipped with the necessary skills to handle large-scale datasets, perform sophisticated statistical analyses, and employ computational tools to derive meaningful insights. This proficiency ensures that researchers can accurately interpret experimental outcomes and draw reliable conclusions.

In the realm of phenomics linked to Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), the relevance of bioinformatics expertise becomes even more pronounced. GWAS involves analyzing genetic variations across a population to identify associations between specific genetic markers and observable traits or diseases. The combination of molecular biology and bioinformatics empowers scientists to explore the molecular underpinnings of these associations.

With a strong understanding of bioinformatics, molecular biologists can unravel the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying phenotypic traits. They can analyze the vast amount of genomic data generated by GWAS and identify candidate genes or genetic variants responsible for specific phenotypes. This knowledge is invaluable in deciphering the genetic basis of complex traits, such as disease susceptibility or drug response, and offers potential insights for personalized medicine and therapeutic interventions.

Moreover, molecular characterization, facilitated by bioinformatics, plays a pivotal role in linking genotype to phenotype. By employing various molecular techniques and utilizing bioinformatics tools, researchers can explore gene expression patterns, protein-protein interactions, and regulatory networks. These investigations shed light on how genetic variations impact cellular processes and contribute to phenotypic variation.

In summary, being a molecular biologist with a deep understanding of bioinformatics empowers researchers to navigate experiments seamlessly and comprehend the entire scientific process. This integrated approach proves crucial in phenomics studies, particularly those linked to GWAS and molecular characterization. The ability to handle and analyze vast datasets, interpret complex genetic associations, and unravel molecular mechanisms paves the way for advancements in personalized medicine and a deeper understanding of the genetic basis of traits and diseases.

I am committed to building community and breaking down barriers that stand in the way of scientific collaboration. I am a founding member of [the Canadian Fungal  Network](https://www.fungalresearch.ca/), an organization whose aim is to strengthen fungal research in Canada by facilitating dialogue among scientists within Canada and abroad. Over the past three years, I've helped organize our annual conference, most significantly as Chair in 2021. The CanFunNet Fungal Biology conference has provided hundreds of trainees with new opportunities to present their work and build their professional networks. As Chair or co-Chair of the Scientific Program at each of the three conferences, I worked with my team to prioritize equitable representation from traditionally marginalized communities. You can read more about the CanFunNet initiative [here](https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/cjm-2020-0263#.XyBF0ShKiUk), and check out the 2021 conference program [here](https://conferences.uwo.ca/JCGMC/home) and the 2022 conference website [here](https://conferences.uwo.ca/canfunnet/).
