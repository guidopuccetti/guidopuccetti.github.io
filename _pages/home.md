### About me

![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/home/headshot.jpg){: style="width: 350px; float: right; border: 100px; padding:25px"}

I am molecular biologist passionate in evolutionary biology and bioinformatics. I integrate bioinformatics with phenomics and molecular experiments to investigate the causes and consequences of phenotypic variation. I am particularly interested in understanding the role of fungicide resistance adaptation to different fungicides classes. 

I am currently a PhD student under the supervision of Dr. [Daniel Croll](http://www.pathogen-genomics.org/) in the Laboratory of Evolutionary Genetics at the University of Neuch√¢tel in Switzerland and Gabriel Scalliet [Gabriel Scalliet](https://twitter.com/ScallietG) Syngenta fellow.
