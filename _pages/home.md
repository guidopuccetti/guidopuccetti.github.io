I am a mycologist and evolutionary biologist who studies the genomic bases of adaptation. The overarching motivation of my research is to understand how organisms evolve as integrated wholes despite experiencing multiple selection pressures over the course of their lives. To answer this question, I use a combination of molecular, manipulative and computational approaches.

As a Presidential Fellow and FRQNT Doctoral Scholar at the Ohio State University working with [Jason C. Slot](https://u.osu.edu/slot.1/), I developed phylogenetic-based algorithms for studying the modularization of fungal genome architecture in response to selection by different plant defense compounds. Since graduating, I have been working as a Postdoctoral Researcher with [Corlett W. Wood](https://www.the-wood-lab.net/) at the Universities of Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania to investigate the evolutionary consequences of genetic trade-offs in multi-species interactions. I will continue developing these research themes beginning in September 2021 as a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow with [Daniel Croll](http://www.pathogen-genomics.org/) at the University of Neuchâtel by determining how genetic and environmental constraints together shape fungal evolution.

Mentorship is an important part of my day-to-day activities, and one of my core responsibilities as a scientist. I work as a career coach through the [ScholarMatch program](https://scholarmatch.org/), whose mission is to support first-generation college students to earn a bachelor's degree. I have also worked as a mentor with the University of Pittsburgh's [Gene Team outreach summer program](https://www.biology.pitt.edu/k-12-outreach/gene-team) for high school students, and am currently working as a mentor in the University of Pennsylvania's FERBS program whose goal is to support students from underrepresented groups transition into college.

I am committed to building community and developing new resources and opportunities for early career researchers. To this end, I serve on the steering committee of [the Canadian Fungal Research Network](https://www.fungalresearch.ca/), an organization whose aim is to strengthen fungal research in Canada by facilitating dialogue among scientists both within Canada and abroad. I helped co-organize our first virtual conference in July 2020, which had 63 speakers and 275 registrants from 89 institutions, and am also co-organizing our next virtual meeting on May 26-28, 2021, held in conjunction with the Great Lakes Mycological Meetings.
