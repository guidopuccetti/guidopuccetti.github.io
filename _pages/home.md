### About me

![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/home/headshot.jpg){: style="width: 350px; float: right; border: 100px; padding:25px"}

I am molecular biologist passionate in evolutionary biology and bioinformatics. I integrate bioinformatics with phenomics and molecular experiments to investigate the causes and consequences of phenotypic variation. I am particularly interested in understanding the role of fungicide resistance adaptation to different fungicides classes. 

I am currently a PhD student under the supervision of Dr. [Daniel Croll](http://www.pathogen-genomics.org/) in the Laboratory of Evolutionary Genetics at the University of Neuch√¢tel in Switzerland and Gabriel Scalliet [Gabriel Scalliet](https://twitter.com/ScallietG). I received my PhD in Plant Pathology with Dr. [Jason C. Slot](https://u.osu.edu/slot.1/) at the Ohio State University in 2019, where I was an OSU Presidential Fellow and FRQNT Doctoral Scholar. In 2021, I completed a postdoc with Dr. [Corlett W. Wood](https://www.the-wood-lab.net/) in the Biology Departments at the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Pennsylvania.
