I am a mycologist and evolutionary biologist who studies the genomic bases of adaptation by integrating molecular, manipulative, and computational experiments.

As a Presidential Fellow and FRQNT Doctoral Scholar at the Ohio State University under the supervision of [Jason C. Slot](https://u.osu.edu/slot.1/), I developed new phylogenetic-based algorithms for studying the evolution of fungal genome architecture in response to selection by plant defense compounds. Since graduating, I have been working as a Postdoctoral Researcher with [Corlett Wolfe Wood](https://www.the-wood-lab.net/) at the Universities of Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania to investigate the evolutionary consequences of genetic constraints in multi-species interactions. I will continue developing these research themes beginning in September 2021 as a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow with [Daniel Croll](http://www.pathogen-genomics.org/) at the University of Neuchâtel by determining how genetic and environmental constraints together shape the evolution of fungal pathogens.

I am committed to promoting scientific literacy and developing resources for my research community. To this end, I am serving as the Postdoc representative on the steering committee of [the Canadian Fungal Research Network](https://www.fungalresearch.ca/), an organization whose aim is to strengthen fungal research in Canada by facilitating dialogue among scientists both within Canada and abroad. I helped co-organize our first conference in July 2020, which had 63 speakers and 275 registrants from 89 institutions, and am also co-organizing our next meeting on May 26-28, 2021, held in conjunction with the Great Lakes Mycological Meetings. You can access the CanFunNet white paper [here](https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/cjm-2020-0263#.XyBF0ShKiUk), the 2020 conference program [here](https://www.fungalresearch.ca/uploads/2/3/5/6/23564534/canfunnet2020_schedule-final.pdf), and apply to the upcoming 2021 conference [here](https://conferences.uwo.ca/JCGMC/home).
