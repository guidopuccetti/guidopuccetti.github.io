I am a mycologist and evolutionary biologist broadly interested in understanding the ecological causes and consequences of evolutionary change. To this end, I have two major research goals: determining the genetic bases of ecological adaptation, and evaluating the impact of ecological adaptation on the evolution of genes and genomes. I integrate hypothesis-driven molecular, manipulative, and computational experiments in a variety of organisms, especially in fungi. 

As a Presidential Fellow and FRQNT Doctoral Scholar at the Ohio State University working with [Jason C. Slot](https://u.osu.edu/slot.1/), I developed phylogenetic-based algorithms for studying the evolution of fungal genome organization in response to selection by  plant defense compounds. Since graduating, I have been working as a Postdoctoral Researcher with [Corlett W. Wood](https://www.the-wood-lab.net/) at the Universities of Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania to investigate the consequences of genetic trade-offs in multi-species interactions. I will continue developing these research themes  in September 2021 as a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow with [Daniel Croll](http://www.pathogen-genomics.org/) at the University of Neuchâtel by determining how genetic and environmental constraints together shape fungal evolution.

Mentorship is an important part of my day-to-day activities, and one of my core responsibilities as a scientist. I work as a career coach through the [ScholarMatch program](https://scholarmatch.org/), whose mission is to support first-generation college students to earn a bachelor's degree. I have also worked as a mentor with the University of Pittsburgh's [Gene Team outreach summer program](https://www.biology.pitt.edu/k-12-outreach/gene-team) for high school students, and am currently working as a mentor in the University of Pennsylvania's FERBS program whose goal is to support students from underrepresented groups transition into college.

I am committed to building community and developing new opportunities for early career researchers. To this end, I serve on the steering committee of [the Canadian Fungal Research Network](https://www.fungalresearch.ca/), an organization whose aim is to strengthen fungal research in Canada by facilitating dialogue among scientists both within Canada and abroad. I co-organized our first virtual conference in July 2020, which had 63 speakers and 275 registrants from 89 institutions, and am leading the co-organization of our next virtual meeting on May 26-28, 2021, held in conjunction with the Great Lakes Mycological Meetings.
