### About me

![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/home/Face_1.png){: style="width: 350px; float: right; border: 100px; padding:25px"}

I am molecular biologist passionate in evolutionary biology and bioinformatics. I integrate bioinformatics with phenomics and molecular experiments to investigate the causes and consequences of phenotypic variation.

I am particularly interested in understanding the role of fungicide resistance adaptation to different fungicides classes.

I am currently a [PhD student](https://pathogen-genomics.org/members/guido-puccetti.html) under the supervision of Dr. [Daniel Croll](http://www.pathogen-genomics.org/) in the Laboratory of Evolutionary Genetics at the University of Neuchâtel in Switzerland and Dr. [Gabriel Scalliet](https://twitter.com/ScallietG) Syngenta fellow.
