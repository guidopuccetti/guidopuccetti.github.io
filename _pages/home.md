### About me

I am a mycologist, evolutionary biologist and genome scientist. I integrate molecular, manipulative, and computational experiments to investigate the causes and consequences of structural variation in genomes. I am particularly interested in understanding the role of structural variation in facilitating and constraining species interactions. I work with taxonomically diverse fungi, mostly plant pathogens and endophytes, and have also forged ongoing collaborations in bacterial and plant systems. 

I am currently a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow working with Dr. [Daniel Croll](http://www.pathogen-genomics.org/) in the Laboratory of Evolutionary Genetics at the University of Neuchâtel in Switzerland. I received my PhD in Plant Pathology with Dr. [Jason C. Slot](https://u.osu.edu/slot.1/) at the Ohio State University in 2019, where I was an OSU Presidential Fellow and FRQNT Doctoral Scholar. In 2021, I completed a postdoc with Dr. [Corlett W. Wood](https://www.the-wood-lab.net/) in the Biology Departments at the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Pennsylvania. 

### Mentorship and service

I believe that anyone can be a successful scientist, irrespective of background or identity. I have worked as a career coach through the [ScholarMatch program](https://scholarmatch.org/), whose mission is to support first-generation college students to earn a bachelor's degree. I have also worked as a mentor with the University of Pittsburgh's [Gene Team outreach summer program](https://www.biology.pitt.edu/k-12-outreach/gene-team) for high school students, and as a mentor in the University of Pennsylvania's FERBS program whose goal is to support students from underrepresented groups transition into undergraduate biology programs.

I am committed to building community and breaking down barriers in the way of scientific collaboration. I am a founding member of [the Canadian Fungal Research Network](https://www.fungalresearch.ca/), an organization whose aim is to strengthen fungal research in Canada by facilitating dialogue among scientists within Canada and abroad. Over the past three years, I've helped organize our annual national conference, most significantly as conference Chair in 2021. The CanFunNet Fungal Biology conference has provided hundreds of trainees with new opportunities to present their work and build their professional networks. As Chair or co-Chair of the Scientific Program at each of the three conferences, I worked with my team to prioritize equitable representation from traditionally marginalized communities. You can read more about the CanFunNet initiative [here](https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/cjm-2020-0263#.XyBF0ShKiUk), and check out the 2021 conference program [here](https://conferences.uwo.ca/JCGMC/home) and the 2022 conference website [here](https://conferences.uwo.ca/canfunnet/).
