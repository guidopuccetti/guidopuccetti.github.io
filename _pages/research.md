## Research overview

Genetic variation is the ultimate source of all evolutionary adaptations and innovations.  Traditionally, genetic variation is measured by calculating differences among individuals at single nucleotide sites. Yet it is increasingly apparent that individuals also differ extensively in the content and organization of their genomes. Our understanding of how this "structural" variation impacts evolution is still in its infancy, yet it likely has distinct implications for the emergence and maintenance of adaptive traits. This is because structural mutations often change large amounts of sequence at a time (e.g., insertions and deletions), affect inheritance patterns across alleles and loci (e.g., inversions and rearrangements), and can even jump around within and between genomes (e.g., transposons and other mobile elements). Identifying the mechanisms generating selectable variation in genome structure and their phenotypic consequences is thus crucial for deciphering the genetic bases of adaptation.
