# Research

My goal is to investigate the evolutionary processes and genetic mechanisms that accelerate or constrain adaptation. 

### Past and ongoing projects

As a Presidential Fellow and FRQNT Doctoral Scholar at the Ohio State University working with [Jason C. Slot](https://u.osu.edu/slot.1/), I developed new algorithms for studying the evolution of genome organization across the fungal kingdom in response to selection by plant defense compounds. I then worked with [Corlett W. Wood](https://www.the-wood-lab.net/) as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Pennsylvania to learn new techniques for studying genetic trade-offs in a model mutualism that can be applied to understand how fungal endophytes adapt across ecological contexts. I am now a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow with [Daniel Croll](http://www.pathogen-genomics.org/) at the University of Neuchâtel investigating the evolutionary origins and phenotypic impacts of structural variation in fungal genomes. Throughout my doctoral and postdoctoral training, I have  developed  independent collaborations with other early career researchers, including an ongoing and far-ranging project to characterize a novel group of massive transposons that mobilize ecological traits.
