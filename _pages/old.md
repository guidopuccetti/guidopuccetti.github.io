Throughout my career, I have sought out independent collaborations with other early career researchers, including a new far-ranging project to characterize a novel group of massive mobile elements that mobilize ecological traits in fungi. 

with two other early career researchers, [Horacio Lopez-Nicora](https://plantpath.osu.edu/our-people/horacio-lopez-nicora) (Ohio State U.) and [Aaron Vogan](https://www.iob.uu.se/research/systematic-biology/aaron-vogan/) (Uppsala U.), 

As a Presidential Fellow and FRQNT Doctoral Scholar at the Ohio State University working with [Jason C. Slot](https://u.osu.edu/slot.1/), I developed new algorithms for studying the evolution of genome organization across the fungal kingdom in response to selection by plant defense compounds. I then worked with [Corlett W. Wood](https://www.the-wood-lab.net/) as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Pennsylvania to learn new techniques for studying genetic trade-offs in a model plant system that can be applied to understand how fungal endophytes adapt across ecological contexts. I am now a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow with [Daniel Croll](http://www.pathogen-genomics.org/) at the University of Neuchâtel investigating the  origins and phenotypic impacts of structural variation. Throughout my career, I have  sought out  independent collaborations with other early career researchers, including a new far-ranging project to characterize a novel group of massive mobile elements that mobilize ecological traits in fungi. 

Fungi are the primary agents of plant disease and plant mutualism, and thus represent both emerging threats and opportunities for meeting the world's food, fiber and energy demands. However, managing their interactions with plants is challenging because fungi evolve and acquire new traits rapidly, and often switch between plant-associated lifestyles and free-living stages (Fig.1). Given that improving one trait often comes at the expense of another, this raises an evolutionary conundrum: how do plant-associated fungi adapt while engaging in multiple symbioses? 



My research thus has two main objectives: to investigate the genetic bases of host-microbe interactions and to identify drivers and constraints on multi-species interactions. My goal is to use the resulting insights to inform strategies for ecosystem stewardship while building a deeper understanding of the genetic bases of adaptation.

To this end, I have two main research goals: identifying genomic solutions for survival across ecological niches, and in turn, evaluating how selection shapes the ongoing evolution of genes and genomes. I work to answer these questions in a variety of systems, mostly plant pathogens and endophytes, using a combination of molecular, manipulative, and computational experiments.
